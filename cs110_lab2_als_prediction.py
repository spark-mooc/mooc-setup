# MAGIC # Predicting Movie Ratings
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One of the most common uses of big data is to predict what users want.  This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user.  We will start with some basic techniques, and then use the [Spark ML][sparkml] library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For this lab, we will use a subset dataset of 20 million ratings. This dataset is pre-mounted on Databricks and is from the [MovieLens stable benchmark rating dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). However, the same code you write will also work on the full dataset (though running with the full dataset on Community Edition is likely to take quite a long time).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this lab:
# MAGIC * *Part 0*: Preliminaries
# MAGIC * *Part 1*: Basic Recommendations
# MAGIC * *Part 2*: Collaborative Filtering
# MAGIC * *Part 3*: Predictions for Yourself
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As mentioned during the first Learning Spark lab, think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you are using a small dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to get a sense for the data locally (in the driver program) will work fine, but this will not work when you are using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will likely fail in the autograder and not receive full credit.

# MAGIC ## Code
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This assignment can be completed using basic Python and pySpark DataFrame Transformations and Actions.  Libraries other than math are not necessary. With the exception of the ML functions that we introduce in this assignment, you should be able to complete all parts of this homework using only the Spark functions you have used in prior lab exercises (although you are welcome to use more features of Spark if you like!).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We'll be using motion picture data, the same data last year's CS100.1x used. However, in this course, we're using DataFrames, rather than RDDs.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following cell defines the locations of the data files. If you want to run an exported version of this lab on your own machine (i.e., outside of Databricks), you'll need to download your own copy of the 20-million movie data set, and you'll need to adjust the paths, below.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **To Do**: Run the following cell.

# COMMAND ----------

import os
from databricks_test_helper import Test

dbfs_dir = '/databricks-datasets/cs110x/ml-20m/data-001'
ratings_filename = dbfs_dir + '/ratings.csv'
movies_filename = dbfs_dir + '/movies.csv'

# The following line is here to enable this notebook to be exported as source and
# run on a local machine with a local copy of the files. Just change the dbfs_dir,
# above.
if os.path.sep != '/':
  # Handle Windows.
  ratings_filename = ratings_filename.replace('/', os.path.sep)
  movie_filename = movie_filename.replace('/', os.path.sep)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Part 0: Preliminaries
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We read in each of the files and create a DataFrame consisting of parsed lines.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### The 20-million movie sample
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The 20-million movie sample consists of CSV files (with headers), so there's no need to parse the files manually, as Spark CSV can do the job.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC First, let's take a look at the directory containing our files.

# COMMAND ----------

display(dbutils.fs.ls(dbfs_dir))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### CPU vs I/O tradeoff
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note that we have both compressed files (ending in `.gz`) and uncompressed files. We have a CPU vs. I/O tradeoff here. If I/O is the bottleneck, then we want to process the compressed files and pay the extra CPU overhead. If CPU is the bottleneck, then it makes more sense to process the uncompressed files.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We've done some experiments, and we've determined that CPU is more of a bottleneck than I/O, on Community Edition. So, we're going to process the uncompressed data. In addition, we're going to speed things up further by specifying the DataFrame schema explicitly. (When the Spark CSV adapter infers the schema from a CSV file, it has to make an extra pass over the file. That'll slow things down here, and it isn't really necessary.)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **To Do**: Run the following cell, which will define the schemas.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.types import *

ratings_df_schema = StructType(
  [StructField('userId', IntegerType()),
   StructField('movieId', IntegerType()),
   StructField('rating', DoubleType())]
)
movies_df_schema = StructType(
  [StructField('ID', IntegerType()),
   StructField('title', StringType())]
)

# MAGIC ### Load and Cache
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Databricks File System (DBFS) sits on top of S3. We're going to be accessing this data a lot. Rather than read it over and over again from S3, we'll cache both
# MAGIC the movies DataFrame and the ratings DataFrame in memory.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **To Do**: Run the following cell to load and cache the data. Please be patient: The code takes about 30 seconds to run.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Part 1: Basic Recommendations
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One way to recommend movies is to always recommend the movies with the highest average rating. In this part, we will use Spark to find the name, number of ratings, and the average rating of the 20 movies with the highest average rating and at least 500 reviews. We want to filter our movies with high ratings but greater than or equal to 500 reviews because movies with few reviews may not have broad appeal to everyone.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### (1a) Movies with Highest Average Ratings
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's determine the movies with the highest average ratings.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The steps you should perform are:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Recall that the `ratings_df` contains three columns:
# MAGIC     - The ID of the user who rated the film
# MAGIC     - the ID of the movie being rated
# MAGIC     - and the rating.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC    First, transform `ratings_df` into a second DataFrame, `movie_ids_with_avg_ratings`, with the following columns:
# MAGIC     - The movie ID
# MAGIC     - The number of ratings for the movie
# MAGIC     - The average of all the movie's ratings
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 2. Transform `movie_ids_with_avg_ratings` to another DataFrame, `movie_names_with_avg_ratings_df` that adds the movie name to each row. `movie_names_with_avg_ratings_df`
# MAGIC    will contain these columns:
# MAGIC     - The movie ID
# MAGIC     - The movie name
# MAGIC     - The number of ratings for the movie
# MAGIC     - The average of all the movie's ratings
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC    **Hint**: You'll need to do a join.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You should end up with something like the following:
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC movie_ids_with_avg_ratings_df:
# MAGIC +-------+-----+------------------+
# MAGIC |movieId|count|average           |

# MAGIC ## Part 2: Collaborative Filtering
# MAGIC In this course, you have learned about many of the basic transformations and actions that Spark allows us to apply to distributed datasets.  Spark also exposes some higher level functionality; in particular, Machine Learning using a component of Spark called [MLlib][mllib].  In this part, you will learn how to use MLlib to make personalized movie recommendations using the movie data we have been analyzing.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://courses.edx.org/c4x/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/asset/Collaborative_filtering.gif" alt="collaborative filtering" style="float: right"/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We are going to use a technique called [collaborative filtering][collab]. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. You can read more about collaborative filtering [here][collab2].
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The image at the right (from [Wikipedia][collab]) shows an example of predicting of the user's rating using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image below the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <br clear="all"/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ----
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For movie recommendations, we start with a matrix whose entries are movie ratings by users (shown in red in the diagram below).  Each column represents a user (shown in green) and each row represents a particular movie (shown in blue).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Since not all users have rated all movies, we do not know all of the entries in this matrix, which is precisely why we need collaborative filtering.  For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.  With collaborative filtering, the idea is to approximate the ratings matrix by factorizing it as the product of two matrices: one that describes properties of each user (shown in green), and one that describes properties of each movie (shown in blue).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img alt="factorization" src="http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/matrix_factorization.png" style="width: 885px"/>
# MAGIC <br clear="all"/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We want to select these two matrices such that the error for the users/movie pairs where we know the correct ratings is minimized.  The [Alternating Least Squares][als] algorithm does this by first randomly filling the users matrix with values and then optimizing the value of the movies such that the error is minimized.  Then, it holds the movies matrix constant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the "alternating" in the name.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This optimization is what's being shown on the right in the image above.  Given a fixed set of user factors (i.e., values in the users matrix), we use the known ratings to find the best values for the movie factors using the optimization written at the bottom of the figure.  Then we "alternate" and pick the best user factors given fixed movie factors.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For a simple example of what the users and movies matrices might look like, check out the [videos from Lecture 2][videos] or the [slides from Lecture 8][slides]

# MAGIC ### (2a) Creating a Training Set
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Before we jump into using machine learning, we need to break up the `ratings_df` dataset into three pieces:
# MAGIC * A training set (DataFrame), which we will use to train models
# MAGIC * A validation set (DataFrame), which we will use to choose the best model
# MAGIC * A test set (DataFrame), which we will use for our experiments
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To randomly split the dataset into the multiple groups, we can use the pySpark [randomSplit()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.randomSplit) transformation. `randomSplit()` takes a set of splits and a seed and returns multiple DataFrames.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC After splitting the dataset, your training set has about 12 million entries and the validation and test sets each have about 4 million entries. (The exact number of entries in each dataset varies slightly due to the random nature of the `randomSplit()` transformation.)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### (2b) Alternating Least Squares
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this part, we will use the Apache Spark ML Pipeline implementation of Alternating Least Squares, [ALS](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS). ALS takes a training dataset (DataFrame) and several parameters that control the model creation process. To determine the best values for the parameters, we will use ALS to train several models, and then we will select the best model and use the parameters from that model in the rest of this lab exercise.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The process we will use for determining the best model is as follows:
# MAGIC 1. Pick a set of model parameters. The most important parameter to model is the *rank*, which is the number of columns in the Users matrix (green in the diagram above) or the number of rows in the Movies matrix (blue in the diagram above). In general, a lower rank will mean higher error on the training dataset, but a high rank may lead to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).  We will train models with ranks of 4, 8, and 12 using the `training_df` dataset.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 2. Set the appropriate parameters on the `ALS` object:
# MAGIC     * The "User" column will be set to the values in our `userId` DataFrame column.
# MAGIC     * The "Item" column will be set to the values in our `movieId` DataFrame column.
# MAGIC     * The "Rating" column will be set to the values in our `rating` DataFrame column.
# MAGIC     * We'll using a regularization parameter of 0.1.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC    **Note**: Read the documentation for the [ALS](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS) class **carefully**. It will help you accomplish this step.
# MAGIC 3. Have the ALS output transformation (i.e., the result of [ALS.fit()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS.fit)) produce a _new_ column
# MAGIC    called "prediction" that contains the predicted value.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 4. Create multiple models using [ALS.fit()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.recommendation.ALS.fit), one for each of our rank values. We'll fit
# MAGIC    against the training data set (`training_df`).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 5. For each model, we'll run a prediction against our validation data set (`validation_df`) and check the error.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 6. We'll keep the model with the best error rate.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Why are we doing our own cross-validation?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A challenge for collaborative filtering is how to provide ratings to a new user (a user who has not provided *any* ratings at all). Some recommendation systems choose to provide new users with a set of default ratings (e.g., an average value across all ratings), while others choose to provide no ratings for new users. Spark's ALS algorithm yields a NaN (`Not a Number`) value when asked to provide a rating for a new user.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Using the ML Pipeline's [CrossValidator](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.tuning.CrossValidator) with ALS is thus problematic, because cross validation involves dividing the training data into a set of folds (e.g., three sets) and then using those folds for testing and evaluating the parameters during the parameter grid search process. It is likely that some of the folds will contain users that are not in the other folds, and, as a result, ALS produces NaN values for those new users. When the CrossValidator uses the Evaluator (RMSE) to compute an error metric, the RMSE algorithm will return NaN. This will make *all* of the parameters in the parameter grid appear to be equally good (or bad).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can read the discussion on [Spark JIRA 14489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14489) about this issue. There are proposed workarounds of having ALS provide default values or having RMSE drop NaN values. Both introduce potential issues. We have chosen to have RMSE drop NaN values. While this does not solve the underlying issue of ALS not predicting a value for a new user, it does provide some evaluation value. We manually implement the parameter grid search process using a for loop (below) and remove the NaN values before using RMSE.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For a production application, you would want to consider the tradeoffs in how to handle new users.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Note**: This cell will likely take a couple of minutes to run.

# MAGIC ### (2c) Testing Your Model
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC So far, we used the `training_df` and `validation_df` datasets to select the best model.  Since we used these two datasets to determine what model is best, we cannot use them to test how good the model is; otherwise, we would be very vulnerable to [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).  To decide how good our model is, we need to use the `test_df` dataset.  We will use the `best_rank` you determined in part (2b) to create a model for predicting the ratings for the test dataset and then we will compute the RMSE.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The steps you should perform are:
# MAGIC * Run a prediction, using `my_model` as created above, on the test dataset (`test_df`), producing a new `predict_df` DataFrame.
# MAGIC * Filter out unwanted NaN values (necessary because of [a bug in Spark](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14489)). We've supplied this piece of code for you.
# MAGIC * Use the previously created RMSE evaluator, `reg_eval` to evaluate the filtered DataFrame.

# MAGIC Looking at the RMSE for the results predicted by the model versus the values in the test set is one way to evalute the quality of our model. Another way to evaluate the model is to evaluate the error from a test set where every rating is the average rating for the training set.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The steps you should perform are:
# MAGIC * Use the `training_df` to compute the average rating across all movies in that training dataset.
# MAGIC * Use the average rating that you just determined and the `test_df` to create a DataFrame (`test_for_avg_df`) with a `prediction` column containing the average rating. **HINT**: You'll want to use the `lit()` function,
# MAGIC   from `pyspark.sql.functions`, available here as `F.lit()`.
# MAGIC * Use our previously created `reg_eval` object to evaluate the `test_for_avg_df` and calculate the RMSE.

# MAGIC ## Part 3: Predictions for Yourself
# MAGIC The ultimate goal of this lab exercise is to predict what movies to recommend to yourself.  In order to do that, you will first need to add ratings for yourself to the `ratings_df` dataset.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **(3a) Your Movie Ratings**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To help you provide ratings for yourself, we have included the following code to list the names and movie IDs of the 50 highest-rated movies from `movies_with_500_ratings_or_more` which we created in part 1 the lab.

# COMMAND ----------

print 'Most rated movies:'
print '(average rating, movie name, number of reviews, movie ID)'
display(movies_with_500_ratings_or_more.orderBy(movies_with_500_ratings_or_more['average'].desc()).take(50))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The user ID 0 is unassigned, so we will use it for your ratings. We set the variable `my_user_ID` to 0 for you. Next, create a new DataFrame called `my_ratings_df`, with your ratings for at least 10 movie ratings. Each entry should be formatted as `(my_user_id, movieID, rating)`.  As in the original dataset, ratings should be between 1 and 5 (inclusive). If you have not seen at least 10 of these movies, you can increase the parameter passed to `take()` in the above cell until there are 10 movies that you have seen (or you can also guess what your rating would be for movies you have not seen).

# COMMAND ----------

# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code
from pyspark.sql import Row

     <FILL IN>
     # The format of each line is (my_user_id, movie ID, your rating)
     # For example, to give the movie "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)" a five rating, you would add the following line:

# MAGIC ### (3b) Add Your Movies to Training Dataset
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Now that you have ratings for yourself, you need to add your ratings to the `training` dataset so that the model you train will incorporate your preferences.  Spark's [unionAll()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.unionAll) transformation combines two DataFrames; use `unionAll()` to create a new training dataset that includes your ratings and the data in the original training dataset.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC So far, we have only computed the error of the model.  Next, let's predict what ratings you would give to the movies that you did not already provide ratings for.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The steps you should perform are:
# MAGIC * Filter out the movies you already rated manually. (Use the `my_rated_movie_ids` variable.) Put the results in a new `not_rated_df`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC    **Hint**: The [Column.isin()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.2/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.Column.isin)
# MAGIC    method, as well as the `~` ("not") DataFrame logical operator, may come in handy here. Here's an example of using `isin()`:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC     > df1 = sqlContext.createDataFrame([("Jim", 10), ("Julie", 9), ("Abdul", 20), ("Mireille", 19)], ["name", "age"])
# MAGIC     > df1.show()

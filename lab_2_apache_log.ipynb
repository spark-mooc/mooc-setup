    " \n",
    "####This lab will demonstrate how easy it is to perform web server log analysis with Apache Spark.\n",
    " \n",
    "####Server log analysis is an ideal use case for Spark.  It's a very large, common data source and contains a rich set of information.  Spark allows you to store your logs in files on disk cheaply, while still providing a quick and simple way to perform data analysis on them.  This homework will show you how to use Apache Spark on real-world text-based production logs and fully harness the power of that data.  Log data comes from many sources, such as web, file, and compute servers, application logs, user-generated content,  and can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, fraud detection, and much more."

    "# **Spark Tutorial: Learning Apache Spark**\n",
    "#### This tutorial will teach you how to use [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), a framework for large-scale data processing, within a notebook. Many traditional frameworks were designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark has efficient implementations of a number of transformations and actions that can be composed together to perform data processing and analysis.  Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details.  Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency.  With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n",

When running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext).  When the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications.

Each partition holds a unique subset of the entries in the list.  Spark calls datasets that it stores \"Resilient Distributed Datasets\" (RDDs).\n",
    "#### One of the defining features of Spark, compared to other data analytics frameworks (e.g., Hadoop), is that it stores data in memory rather than on disk.  This allows Spark applications to run much more quickly, because they are not slowed down by needing to read data from disk.\n",
    "#### The figure below illustrates how Spark breaks a list of data entries into partitions that are each stored in memory on a worker.\n",
    "![partitions](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/partitions.png)\n",
    "#### To create the RDD, we use `sc.parallelize()`, which tells Spark to create a new set of input data based on data that is passed in.  In this example, we will provide an `xrange`.  The second argument to the [sc.parallelize()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext.parallelize) method tells Spark how many partitions to break the data into when it stores the data in memory (we'll talk more about this later in this tutorial). Note that for better performance when using `parallelize`, `xrange()` is recommended if the input represents a range. This is the reason why we used `xrange()` in 3a.\n",
    "#### There are many different types of RDDs.  The base class for RDDs is [pyspark.RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD) and other RDDs subclass `pyspark.RDD`.  Since the other RDD types inherit from `pyspark.RDD` they have the same APIs and are functionally identical.  We'll see that `sc.parallelize()` generates a `pyspark.rdd.PipelinedRDD` when its input is an `xrange`, and a `pyspark.RDD` when its input is a `range`.\n",
    "#### After we generate RDDs, we can view them in the \"Storage\" tab of the web UI.  You'll notice that new datasets are not listed until Spark needs to return a result due to an action being executed.  This feature of Spark is called \"lazy evaluation\".  This allows Spark to avoid performing unnecessary calculations."

Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n",

When you run `map()` on a dataset, a single *stage* of tasks is launched.  A *stage* is a group of tasks that all perform the same computation, but on different input data.  One task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine. When we run `map(f)` within a partition, a new *task* applies `f` to all of the entries in a particular partition, and outputs a new partition. In this example figure, the dataset is broken into four partitions, so four `map()` tasks are launched.\n",

The key advantage of using `takeOrdered()` instead of `first()` or `take()` is that `takeOrdered()` returns a deterministic result, while the other two actions may return differing results, depending on the number of partions or execution environment. `takeOrdered()` returns the list sorted in *ascending order*.

Spark spills data to disk when there is more data shuffled onto a single executor machine than can fit in memory.

    "# **Principal Component Analysis Lab**\n",
    "#### This lab delves into exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation. We will use a dataset of light-sheet imaging recorded by the [Ahrens Lab](http://www.janelia.org/lab/ahrens-lab) at Janelia Research Campus, and hosted on the CodeNeuro [data repository](http://datasets.codeneuro.org).\n",
    "#### Our dataset is generated by studying the movement of a larval [zebrafish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish), an animal that is especially useful in neuroscience because it is transparent, making it possible to record activity over its entire brain using a technique called [light-sheet microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sheet_fluorescence_microscopy).   Specifically, we'll work with time-varying images containing patterns of the zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern.   Different stimuli induce different patterns across the brain, and we can use exploratory analyses to identify these patterns.  Read [\"Mapping brain activity at scale with cluster computing\"](http://thefreemanlab.com/work/papers/freeman-2014-nature-methods.pdf) for more information about these kinds of analyses.\n",
    "#### During this lab you will learn about PCA, and then compare and contrast different exploratory analyses of the same data set to identify which neural patterns they best highlight.\n",

    "#### Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a strategy for dimensionality reduction. To better understand PCA, we'll work with synthetic data generated by sampling from the [two-dimensional Gaussian distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution).  This distribution takes as input the mean and variance of each dimension, as well as the covariance between the two dimensions.\n",

We will explore two different values for the covariance: 0 and 0.9. When the covariance is zero, the two dimensions are uncorrelated, and hence the data looks spherical.  In contrast, when the covariance is 0.9, the two dimensions are strongly (positively) correlated and thus the data is non-spherical.  As we'll see in Parts 1 and 2, the non-spherical data is amenable to dimensionality reduction via PCA, while the spherical data is not."

    "#### A central challenge in neuroscience is understanding the organization and function of neurons, the cells responsible for processing and representing information in the brain. New technologies make it possible to monitor the responses of large populations of neurons in awake animals. In general, neurons communicate through electrical impulses that must be recorded with electrodes, which is a challenging process. As an alternative, we can genetically engineer animals so that their neurons express special proteins that flouresce or light up when active, and then use microscopy to record neural activity as images. A recently developed method called light-sheet microscopy lets us do this in a special, transparent animal, the larval zebrafish, over nearly its entire brain. The resulting data are time-varying images containing the activity of hundreds of thousands of neurons. Given the raw data, which is enormous, we want to find compact spatial and temporal patterns: Which groups of neurons are active together? What is the time course of their activity? Are those patterns specific to particular events happening during the experiment (e.g. a stimulus that we might present). PCA is a powerful technique for finding spatial and temporal patterns in these kinds of data, and that's what we'll explore here!"

We then use the well-known polar color space, [hue-saturation-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) (HSV), and map the angle to hue and the magnitude to value (brightness).  This maps low magnitude points to black while allowing larger magnitude points to be differentiated by their angle. Additionally, the function `polarTransform` that maps low-dimensional representations to colors has an input parameter called `scale`, which we set  to 2.0, and you can try lower values for the two graphs to see more nuanced mappings -- values near 1.0 are particularly interesting."

    " \n",
    "#### In the analysis in Part 3, we performed PCA on the full time series data, trying to find global patterns across all 240 seconds of the time series. However, our analysis doesn't use the fact that different events happened during those 240 seconds. Specifically, during those 240 seconds, the zebrafish was presented with 12 different direction-specific visual patterns, with each one lasting for 20 seconds, for a total of 12 x 20 = 240 features. Stronger patterns are likely to emerge if we incorporate knowledge of our experimental setup into our analysis.  As we'll see, we can isolate the impact of temporal response or direction-specific impact by appropriately aggregating our features.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### In order to aggregate the features we will use basic ideas from matrix multiplication.  First, note that if we use `np.dot` with a two-dimensional array, then NumPy performs the equivalent matrix-multiply calculation.  For example, `np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]).dot(np.array([2, 0, 1]))` produces `np.array([5, 14])`.\n",
    "#### $$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\\\ 14 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "#### By setting up our multi-dimensional array properly we can multiply it by a vector to perform certain aggregation operations.  For example, imagine we had a 3 dimensional vector, $ \\scriptsize \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}^\\top $  and we wanted to create a 2 dimensional vector containing the sum of its first and last elements as one value and three times its second value as another value, i.e., $ \\scriptsize \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}^\\top $. We can generate this result via matrix multiplication as follows: `np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0]]).dot(np.array([1, 2, 3])` which produces `np.array([4, 6]`.\n",

For example, we might find all neurons that prefer one stimulus direction, and then do an experiment in which we stimulate or inactivate only those neurons and look at the effect on the animal's behavior. Alternatively, we might subdivide neurons into groups based on simple forms of stimulus selectivity like the ones analyzed here, and then estimate coupling across different neuronal populations, i.e. can we predict one population's response as a function of another. This can  be framed as a massive pair-wise regression problem, related to techniques you learned earlier in the course, and demanding large-scale implementations."

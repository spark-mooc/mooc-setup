    "# **Math and Python review and CTR data download**\n",
    "#### This notebook reviews vector and matrix math, the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) Python package, and Python lambda expressions.  It also covers downloading the data required for Lab 4, where you will analyze website click-through rates.  Part 1 covers vector and matrix math, and you'll do a few exercises by hand.  In Part 2, you'll learn about NumPy and use `ndarray` objects to solve the math exercises.   Part 3 provides additional information about NumPy and how it relates to array usage in Spark's [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/).  Part 4 provides an overview of lambda expressions, and you'll wrap up by downloading the dataset for Lab 4.\n",
    "#### To move through the notebook just run each of the cells.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.  You should move through the notebook from top to bottom and run all of the cells.  If you skip some cells, later cells might not work as expected.\n",
    "#### Note that there are several exercises within this notebook.  You will need to provide solutions for cells that start with: `# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code`.\n",

You can create a new `DenseVector` using `DenseVector()` and passing in an NumPy array or a Python list.\n",

    "#### Note that `DenseVector` stores all values as `np.float64`, so even if you pass in an NumPy array of integers, the resulting `DenseVector` will contain floating-point numbers. Also, `DenseVector` objects exist locally and are not inherently distributed.  `DenseVector` objects can be used in the distributed setting by either passing functions that contain them to resilient distributed dataset (RDD) transformations or by distributing them directly as RDDs.  You'll learn more about RDDs in the spark tutorial.\n",

For example, `lambda x, y: x + y` is an anonymous function that computes the sum of its two inputs.\n",

In that case, the lambda expression generates a function that is bound to the parameter being passed into the function.\n",

The syntax could be either: `lambda x: x[0] + x[1]` or `lambda (x0, x1): x0 + x1`.  If we called either function on the tuple `(3, 4)` it would return `7`.  Note that the second `lambda` relies on the tuple `(3, 4)` being unpacked automatically, which means that `x0` is assigned the value `3` and `x1` is assigned the value `4`.\n",

In functional programming, you will often pass functions to other functions as parameters, and `lambda` can be used to reduce the amount of code necessary and to make the code more readable.\n",
